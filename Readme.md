# Square Home Launcher Updater

It helps to sync the content of the folders on your home screen to your actual folders in the app drawer. This app assumes that all the folders on your home screen are created by your dragging the folders in the app drawer to the home screen.

1. create a backup in the Square Home `backup center`.
2. Select the root folder named `SquareHome2_backups` and the app will create a modified version of your latest backup. The latest version should have a name ended with a digit.
3. restore to the new version in the `backup center` (do not tick the 'keep folder and category' option).
