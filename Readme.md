# Square Home Launcher Updater

This is a home screen folder update/syncing android app for [Square Home - Launcher : Windows style](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.squarehome2&hl=en)

It helps to update the content of the folders on your home screen in accordance with your actual folders in the app drawer. Currently it assumes that all the folders on your home screen are created by your dragging the folders in the app drawer to the home screen, and that the two corresponding folders still have many shared apps.

## How to use

1. create a backup in the Square Home `backup center`.
2. Select the root folder named `SquareHome2_backups` and the app will create a modified version of your latest backup. The latest version should have a name ended with a digit.
3. restore to the new version in the `backup center` (do not tick the 'keep folder and category' option).

## TODO List:
- [ ] check the home screen folders that were not dragged from the app drawer.
